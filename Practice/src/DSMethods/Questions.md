1. **Array Manipulation:**
    - Rotate an array to the right or left by a given number of steps.
    - Find the maximum subarray sum or product.
    - Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
    - Remove duplicates from a sorted or unsorted array.
    - Implement various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.

2. **Array Searching:**
    - Search for a target element in a sorted or unsorted array (binary search, linear search).
    - Find the indices of two elements in an array that sum up to a specific target.
    - Find the peak element in an array (an element greater than its neighbors).

3. **String Manipulation:**
    - Reverse a string.
    - Check if a string is a palindrome.
    - Implement basic string compression (e.g., "aabcccccaaa" -> "a2b1c5a3").
    - Implement substring search algorithms like Naive String Matching, Rabin-Karp Algorithm, Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm, etc.
    - Find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.

4. **String Parsing:**
    - Parse a string to extract specific information (e.g., extracting numbers, dates, or names).
    - Tokenize a string based on a delimiter (e.g., splitting a CSV file).

5. **Array and String Combination:**
    - Given a string and an array of words, find all words from the array that are substrings of the string.
    - Given a 2D array of characters representing a board and a word, determine if the word exists in the board.
    - Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

6. **Dynamic Programming with Arrays and Strings:**
    - Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
    - Find the minimum number of insertions/deletions to convert one string into another.
    - Determine if a string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.

7. **Miscellaneous:**
    - Implement algorithms to perform basic operations on arrays and strings efficiently (e.g., reversing an array in-place, reversing words in a sentence).
    - Solve problems related to sliding windows, such as finding the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.
